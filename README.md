Base Game - Liar's Dice
============================================================================
A game based on Liar's Dice: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liar%27s_dice.

Five dice are used per player with dice cups used for concealment.

Each round, each player rolls a "hand" of dice under their cup and looks at their hand while keeping it concealed from the other players. The first player begins bidding, announcing any face value and the minimum number of dice that the player believes are showing that value, under all of the cups in the game. Ones are often wild, always counting as the face of the current bid.

Turns rotate among the players in a clockwise order. Each player has two choices during their turn: to make a higher bid, or challenge the previous bidâ€”typically with a call of "liar". Raising the bid means the player may bid a higher quantity of the same face or the same quantity of a higher face.

If the current player challenges the previous bid, all dice are revealed. If the bid is valid (at least as many of the face value and any wild aces are showing as were bid), the bidder wins. Otherwise, the challenger wins. The player who loses a round loses one of their dice. The last player to still retain a die (or dice) is the winner. The loser of the last round starts the bidding on the next round (See New End of Game Concept section). If the loser of the last round was eliminated, the next player starts the new round.


New concepts. Dice Types & Mote Duality, Graveyard, Phases and New Beginning/End of Game.
============================================================================
Dice Types
============================================================================
- There are 6 'motes' that represent dice types. Light, Grey, Neutral, Blue, Red, Dark.
- The five die in Liar's Dice are given a mote type and a sixth mote type at random is chosen as the prize for the game.
- This section is continued after the Graveyard and Phase sections.

Mote Duality
============================================================================
- The 6 mote types are broken into 2 different groups, the Light and Dark groups or
"Redeemed" & "Cursed". These two groups are gameplay and aesthetically opposed and these details are reflected in the way the motes are played due to phase order and the dice effects themselves.

Phases
============================================================================
Sunset, Night, Sunrise:
These phases replace the single bidding round phase in the original game.
- Sunset: First phase of the game and a players turn. Any Die power marked with 'Sunset' can only be played on this phase. 
- Night: Second phase of a players turn and begins with players rolling their die. Once the die has been rolled, any die in the graveyard marked 'Night' can be played in this phase starting with the player who's turn it is. After rolling, players begin the bidding phase as stated in the Liar's Dice original rules. Only the player in next turn order may call out the bluffer.
- Sunrise: Last phase of a players turn and marks the last phase before a player is declared winner/dead or turn order is passed. Any die marked 'Sunrise' can be played in this phase.

Die Graveyard Powers
============================================================================
Light
============================================================================
If this die is in the graveyard, any time during sunset or sunrise,
you may remove this die from the game to return any other dice from the graveyard to your cup.

Grey
=============================================================================
If this die is in the graveyard, any time during sunset or sunrise,
you may remove this die from the game to gain immunity to the next accusation
(if someone were to accuse you of mischief, the game continues as if no accusation happened).

Yellow
=============================================================================
If this die is in the graveyard, any time during sunset or sunrise,
you may exchange this die with another die in your cup.

Blue
=============================================================================
If this die is in the graveyard, any time during the night,
you may remove this die from the game to stop another die's effect from resolving.

Red
=============================================================================
If this die is in the graveyard, any time during the night,
you may remove this die from the game to choose another player and roll a 6 sided die.
If the roll is odd, one player of your choice cant activate any dark die effects until your next turn.
If the roll is even, one player of your choice cant activate any light die effects until your next turn.

Dark
=============================================================================
If this die is in the graveyard, any time during the night,
you may remove this die from the game to remove another die in the graveyard from the game

Graveyard
============================================================================
- When a player loses a bluff they must send a dice to the graveyard.
- A player may only play the die that they lose but may target any other die in the graveyard unless specified otherwise.
- Die in the graveyard can only be played during the phases that they are given based on their Mote Duality (See Mote Duality and Phase sections).

New Beginning Game Concept
============================================================================
At the beginning of the game all players may bid on whether they will be the victor of the next match. The calculation for how much a winner gets from a match is:
Pool + ( Player Bet * ( PlayerBet / PlayerTotalFunds ) ) = Winnings

New End of Game Concept
============================================================================

The mote that is chosen is the prize for the player who has the last remaining dice. In their next run in the ARPG Primal Soul, their winning die is combined with the prize die
to form a Twin Soul based on the mote type combination. All players who are part of the "Redeemed" or "Cursed" Mote Duality party are given a run ticket used to get better loot to be bet during bidding rounds in Motes of Mischief.
